# Vehicle Movement Simulator for the Study of Norm Emergence Through Conflict-Blocking Interactions in Multi-Agent Systems

This simulator is to support the manuscript "Norm Emergence Through Conflict-Blocking Interactions in Multi-Agent Systems". 

To run the simulator, you can download it and open "index.html" in your browser like Chrome or Safari. One way to download is: 

1. Open "https://github.com/yw808/norm".
2. Click the "Code" (upper right corner of the folder "NormEmergence"), and then click "Download ZIP".
3. Extract files in the zip file.

Usage: 1) Use the panel to configure parameters and see statistics; 2) Use mouse drag and wheel to scroll and zoom in/out.

Brief Introduction: A vehicle (agent) can choose to move either on right side or on left side of the road. When two vehicles move toward each other, they are going to perform a passing (conflict-blocking) interaction. The proposed framework is applied by vehicles to perform passing interactions (where ASCS is used as the preferred strategy selection method).
