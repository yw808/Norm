# Vehicle Movement Simulator for the Study of Norm Emergence Through Conflict-Blocking Interactions in Multi-Agent Systems

This simulator is to support the manuscript "Norm Emergence Through Conflict-Blocking Interactions in Multi-Agent Systems".

Usage: 1) Use the panel to configure parameters and see statistics; 2) Use mouse drag and wheel to scroll and zoom in/out. (Tested on Chrome and Safari)

Brief Introduction: A vehicle (agent) can choose to move either on right side or on left side of the road. When two vehicles move toward each other, they are going to perform a passing (conflict-blocking) interaction. The proposed framework is applied by vehicles to perform passing interactions (where ASCS is used as the preferred strategy selection method).
